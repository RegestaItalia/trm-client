## SAP NW RFC SDK (Optional)

> [!NOTE] 
> Starting from `trm-core@6.0.0` (December 2024), the **SAP NW RFC SDK is optional** due to the deprecation of the `node-rfc` library ([GitHub Issue #329](https://github.com/SAP/node-rfc/issues/329)).

The SDK is used only if you're connecting to SAP systems via **RFC**.

➡ [RFC SDK Installation Guide](https://github.com/SAP/node-rfc/blob/main/doc/installation.md#sap-nwrfc-sdk-installation)

### Windows Setup

1. Download the SDK from the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html)
2. Create `C:\nwrfcsdk` and extract the SDK into it
3. Make sure `C:\nwrfcsdk\bin` contains required DLLs like `icudt*.dll`. If not, copy them from `bin\lib`
4. Run `rfcexec` inside the bin folder to verify functionality
5. Set `SAPNWRFC_HOME = C:\nwrfcsdk`
6. Add `C:\nwrfcsdk\bin` to your system `PATH`
7. Restart your terminal session (if open) after setting environment variables.
8. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install node-rfc -g
   ```
   
### MacOS Setup

1. Download the SDK from the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html)
2. Create `/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk` and extract the SDK into it
3. Make sure `/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib` exists
4. Run command `echo $SHELL`
5. If previous command output was `/bin/zsh`, execute `nano ~/.zshrc`. If output was `/bin/bash`, execute `nano ~/.bash_profile` (or `nano ~/.bashrc`)
6. Add new line `export SAPNWRFC_HOME=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk` and save
7. Create a file called `paths_fix.sh` and copy and paste the [code written here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/fundamental-tools/refs/heads/main/docker/sap_nwrfcsdk_utils/paths_fix.sh)
8. Run:
   ```bash
   ./paths_fix.sh
   ```
9. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install node-rfc -g
   ```

## TRM REST API Support (Optional)

Starting with `trm-core@6.0.0`, you can also connect to SAP via **REST APIs**, using [`trm-rest`](https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-rest).

➡ [trm-rest Installation Guide](https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-rest)

## ICU Common Library

> If you installed the [SAP NW RFC SDK](#sap-nw-rfc-sdk-optional) or running on **MacOS**, you can **skip this step**.

### Windows

5. Download the **SAPEXE.SAR** file

#### Extract ICU DLLs from SAPEXE

Run:

```bash
sapcar -xvf SAPEXE_<version>.SAR
```

1. Create `C:\ICU`
2. Move the following files into it:
    - `icuuc*.dll`
    - `icudt*.dll`
    - `icuin*.dll`
3. Add `C:\ICU` to your system `PATH`

   R3trans
   ```
   You should see usage output

## Install `trm-client`

> Restart your terminal session (if open) after setting environment variables.

Install globally:

```bash
npm install trm-client -g
```

Verify:

```bash
trm
```

This will show all available CLI commands.

➡ [trm-client on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trm-client)

## Virtual System (Recommended)

SAP recommends using **Virtual Systems** to avoid leaving transports stuck in queues.

- Set this up on your **central development system**
- Each TRM release should target the virtual system

➡ [SAP Guide – Virtual System Setup](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw73ehp1/7.31.19/en-us/44/b4a0db7acc11d1899e0000e829fbbd/content.htm?no_cache=true)
