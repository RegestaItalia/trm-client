# Full list of commands

A full list of commands that can be used by trm-client can be found by simply typing

`trm`

in your CLI.

# System alias

Because a connection to an SAP ECC/S4 system has a quite a few parameters, connecting to a system by typing all of them via CLI can be challenging.

To solve this problem, you can create a system alias.

A system alias is an easy way to store all of the connection attributes, including login data, of an SAP ECC/S4 system.

System aliases are saved in **plain text** in the AppData `systems.ini` file.

# Registry

Out of the box, trm-client is configured to work with the [public registry](https://trmregistry.com).

It is, however, possible to add as many private registries as you want.

To learn more about private registries, [visit the documentation](https://docs.trmregistry.com).

Registry data is saved in **plain text** in the AppData `registry.ini` file.

### Publish package manifest

The manifest is a document that contains information about a package. Its values can be defined during publishing.

The `-m, --manifest <JSON>` option allows you to define manifest values with a JSON string.

It can either indicate a file path or an acutal JSON string.

The expected object should have these values defined:

- `private` - **required** - `boolean`

    Defines the package visibility.

- `backwardsCompatible` - `boolean`

    Can be ignored if publishing a package for the first time.

    Defines if the release is backwards compatible with its older versions.

- `description` - `string`

    Short description of the package.

- `git` - `string`

    Link to git repository.

- `website` - `string`

    Link to project website.

- `license` - `string`

    Package license.

- `authors` - `string`

    Package authors, separated by comma.

    Valid values are:
    1. `Author 1, Author 2, Author 3...`
    2. `Author 1 <author1@email.com>, Author 2 <author2@email.com>, Author 3 <author3@email.com>...`

- `keywords` - `string`

    Package keywords, separated by comma.

- `dependencies` - `array`

    Defines a list of necessary TRM packages needed in order to avoid dependency errors.

    The array must define object with the following properties:
    - `name` - **required** - `string`

        Package full name.
    
    - `version` - **required** - `string`

        Semver valid version or range.

    - `registry` - `string`

        Registry endpoint.

        If left blank, defaults to public registry.

- `sapEntries` - `object`

    Defines the required table records needed in order to avoid runtime errors.

    Typically, indicates the TADIR dependencies with standard SAP objects.

    The object must have this structure:

    ```json
    {
        "TABLE_NAME1": [{...}],
        "TABLE_NAME2": [{...}],
        "TABLE_NAME3": [{...}]
    }
    ```

    Each table record should contain the required field/value combination needed in order to extract the required record.

The `dependencies` and `sapEntries` values of the manifest are calculated at runtime (unless running with the `-sd, --skipDependencies` flag) and values from the `-m, --manifest <JSON>` json are then merged.

Unless running with the `-om, --overwriteManifest` flag, release-indipendent values are kept the same, and not prompted (unless running with `-fm, --forceManifest` flag). 

## Unpublish package from registry

This command will only remove the package from the registry.

If installed on any of your systems, **it will remain without any changes**.

- Command `trm unpublish <PACKAGE_NAME> <VERSION>`
- Options
    - `-r, --registry <REGISTRY_NAME>` - `string`

        If no private registries are found, it will default to the public registry.

        If one or more registries are found, and this option is not provided, it will prompt for a registry selection.

> Version allowed values are either latest or a semver valid version. Default: latest - If the package is published for the first time, the version is set to 1.0.0 by default; if the package already exists in the registry, the latest version is fetched and the patch version is increased.

        See [Install package replacements](#install-package-replacements) for the detailed explaination.

        Default: `false` - Devclass names are calculated/prompted.

    - `-pr, --packageReplacements <JSON>` - `string`

        Path to JSON file or JSON array of package replacements.

        Ignored if `-k, --keepOriginalPackages` is used.

> If the direct connection options are incomplete you'll be prompted to fill in the required values.

### Install package replacements

Package replacements are the names of devclasses used during install of a package.

These values might be different from the published names.

If the parameter `-k, --keepOriginalPackages` is used, the original published devclass names are used during install.

This might be dangerous because if a devclass with the same name as one of the devclasses to install already exists on your system, it might change its superpackage (thus, its hierarchy).

When the `-k, --keepOriginalPackages` parameter is not used, `-pr, --packageReplacements` can be used to pass the replacement values.

The expected input is either a path to a file or a string with an array in JSON.

This array must have atleast one object, with these properties:

- `originalDevclass` - **required** - `string`

    Name of the original devclass of the package.

- `installDevclass` - **required** - `string`

    Replacement name.

Both install and original devclass names shall not exceede the 30 characters limit and, are subject to namespace validation.

If one or more package replacements are not found, a prompt asking a replacement name is shown on screen.

**Examples**

1.  Package has this devclass structure:

    - ZCUSTOM

    Using the flag `-k, --keepOriginalPackages` will result in a package named `ZCUSTOM` in the install system.

2.  Package has this devclass structure:

    - ZCUSTOM
        - ZCUSTOM_SUB

    Using the option `-pr, --packageReplacements` with the value 
    ```json
    [{
        originalDevclass: "ZCUSTOM",
        installDevclass: "ZINSTALL_CUSTOM"
    }, {
        originalDevclass: "ZCUSTOM_SUB",
        installDevclass: "ZINSTALL_CUSTOM_SUB"
    }]
    ```
    will result in a package named `ZINSTALL_CUSTOM` and a subpackage named `ZINSTALL_CUSTOM_SUB` in the install system.

3.  Package has this devclass structure:

    - ZCUSTOM
        - ZCUSTOM_SUB

    Using the option `-pr, --packageReplacements` with the value 
    ```json
    [{
        originalDevclass: "ZCUSTOM",
        installDevclass: "ZINSTALL_CUSTOM"
    }]
    ```
    will result in a package named `ZINSTALL_CUSTOM` in the install system and a prompt for devclass `ZCUSTOM_SUB`.
